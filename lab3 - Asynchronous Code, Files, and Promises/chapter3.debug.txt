chapter 3 come away come awayfor a moment after mr and mrs darling left the house the nightlights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly they were awfully nice little nightlights and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see peter but wendys light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also and before they could close their mouths all the three went outthere was another light in the room now a thousand times brighter than the nightlights and in the time we have taken to say this it had been in all the drawers in the nursery looking for peters shadow rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out it was not really a light it made this light by flashing about so quickly but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy no longer than your hand but still growing it was a girl called tinker bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf cut low and square through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage she was slightly inclined to embonpointplump hourglass figurea moment after the fairys entrance the window was blown open by the breathing of the little stars and peter dropped in he had carried tinker bell part of the way and his hand was still messy with the fairy dusttinker bell he called softly after making sure that the children were asleep tink where are you she was in a jug for the moment and liking it extremely she had never been in a jug beforeoh do come out of that jug and tell me do you know where they put my shadowthe loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him it is the fairy language you ordinary children can never hear it but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once beforetink said that the shadow was in the big box she meant the chest of drawers and peter jumped at the drawers scattering their contents to the floor with both hands as kings toss hapence to the crowd in a moment he had recovered his shadow and in his delight he forgot that he had shut tinker bell up in the drawerif he thought at all but i dont believe he ever thought it was that he and his shadow when brought near each other would join like drops of water and when they did not he was appalled he tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom but that also failed a shudder passed through peter and he sat on the floor and criedhis sobs woke wendy and she sat up in bed she was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor she was only pleasantly interestedboy she said courteously why are you cryingpeter could be exceeding polite also having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies and he rose and bowed to her beautifully she was much pleased and bowed beautifully to him from the bedwhats your name he askedwendy moira angela darling she replied with some satisfaction what is your namepeter panshe was already sure that he must be peter but it did seem a comparatively short nameis that allyes he said rather sharply he felt for the first time that it was a shortish nameim so sorry said wendy moira angelait doesnt matter peter gulpedshe asked where he livedsecond to the right said peter and then straight on till morningwhat a funny addresspeter had a sinking for the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny addressno it isnt he saidi mean wendy said nicely remembering that she was hostess is that what they put on the lettershe wished she had not mentioned lettersdont get any letters he said contemptuouslybut your mother gets lettersdont have a mother he said not only had he no mother but he had not the slightest desire to have one he thought them very overrated persons wendy however felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedyo peter no wonder you were crying she said and got out of bed and ran to himi wasnt crying about mothers he said rather indignantly i was crying because i cant get my shadow to stick on besides i wasnt cryingit has come offyesthen wendy saw the shadow on the floor looking so draggled and she was frightfully sorry for peter how awful she said but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap how exactly like a boyfortunately she knew at once what to do it must be sewn on she said just a little patronisinglywhats sewn he askedyoure dreadfully ignorantno im notbut she was exulting in his ignorance i shall sew it on for you my little man she said though he was tall as herself and she got out her housewife sewing bag and sewed the shadow on to peters footi daresay it will hurt a little she warned himoh i shant cry said peter who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life and he clenched his teeth and did not cry and soon his shadow was behaving properly though still a little creasedperhaps i should have ironed it wendy said thoughtfully but peter boylike was indifferent to appearances and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee alas he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to wendy he thought he had attached the shadow himself how clever i am he crowed rapturously oh the cleverness of meit is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of peter was one of his most fascinating qualities to put it with brutal frankness there never was a cockier boybut for the moment wendy was shocked you conceit braggart she exclaimed with frightful sarcasm of course i did nothingyou did a little peter said carelessly and continued to dancea little she replied with hauteur pride if i am no use i can at least withdraw and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blanketsto induce her to look up he pretended to be going away and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his footwendy he said dont withdraw i cant help crowing wendy when im pleased with myself still she would not look up though she was listening eagerly wendy he continued in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist wendy one girl is more use than twenty boysnow wendy was every inch a woman though there were not very many inches and she peeped out of the bedclothesdo you really think so peteryes i doi think its perfectly sweet of you she declared and ill get up again and she sat with him on the side of the bed she also said she would give him a kiss if he liked but peter did not know what she meant and he held out his hand expectantlysurely you know what a kiss is she asked aghasti shall know when you give it to me he replied stiffly and not to hurt his feeling she gave him a thimblenow said he shall i give you a kiss and she replied with a slight primness if you please she made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck it was lucky that she did put it on that chain for it was afterwards to save her lifewhen people in our set are introduced it is customary for them to ask each others age and so wendy who always liked to do the correct thing asked peter how old he was it was not really a happy question to ask him it was like an examination paper that asks grammar when what you want to be asked is kings of englandi dont know he replied uneasily but i am quite young he really knew nothing about it he had merely suspicions but he said at a venture wendy i ran away the day i was bornwendy was quite surprised but interested and she indicated in the charming drawingroom manner by a touch on her nightgown that he could sit nearer herit was because i heard father and mother he explained in a low voice talking about what i was to be when i became a man he was extraordinarily agitated now i dont want ever to be a man he said with passion i want always to be a little boy and to have fun so i ran away to kensington gardens and lived a long long time among the fairiesshe gave him a look of the most intense admiration and he thought it was because he had run away but it was really because he knew fairies wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful she poured out questions about them to his surprise for they were rather a nuisance to him getting in his way and so on and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding spanking still he liked them on the whole and he told her about the beginning of fairiesyou see wendy when the first baby laughed for the first time its laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about and that was the beginning of fairiestedious talk this but being a stayathome she liked itand so he went on goodnaturedly there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girlought to be isnt thereno you see children know such a lot now they soon dont believe in fairies and every time a child says i dont believe in fairies there is a fairy somewhere that falls down deadreally he thought they had now talked enough about fairies and it struck him that tinker bell was keeping very quiet i cant think where she has gone to he said rising and he called tink by name wendys heart went flutter with a sudden thrillpeter she cried clutching him you dont mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this roomshe was here just now he said a little impatiently you dont hear her do you and they both listenedthe only sound i hear said wendy is like a tinkle of bellswell thats tink thats the fairy language i think i hear her toothe sound came from the chest of drawers and peter made a merry face no one could ever look quite so merry as peter and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh he had his first laugh stillwendy he whispered gleefully i do believe i shut her up in the drawerhe let poor tink out of the drawer and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury you shouldnt say such things peter retortedof course im very sorry but how could i know you were in the drawerwendy was not listening to him o peter she cried if she would only stand still and let me see herthey hardly ever stand still he said but for one moment wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock o the lovely she cried though tinks face was still distorted with passiontink said peter amiably this lady says she wishes you were her fairytinker bell answered insolentlywhat does she say peterhe had to translate she is not very polite she says you are a greathuge ugly girl and that she is my fairyhe tried to argue with tink you know you cant be my fairy tink because i am an gentleman and you are a ladyto this tink replied in these words you silly ass and disappeared into the bathroom she is quite a common fairy peter explained apologetically she is called tinker bell because she mends the pots and kettles tinker  tin worker similar to cinder plus elle to get cinderellathey were together in the armchair by this time and wendy plied him with more questionsif you dont live in kensington gardens nowsometimes i do stillbut where do you live mostly nowwith the lost boyswho are theythey are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way if they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the neverland to defray expenses im captainwhat fun it must beyes said cunning peter but we are rather lonely you see we have no female companionshipare none of the others girlsoh no girls you know are much too clever to fall out of their pramsthis flattered wendy immensely i think she said it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls john there just despises usfor reply peter rose and kicked john out of bed blankets and all one kick this seemed to wendy rather forward for a first meeting and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house however john continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there and i know you meant to be kind she said relentingso you may give me a kissfor the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses i thought you would want it back he said a little bitterly and offered to return her the thimbleoh dear said the nice wendy i dont mean a kiss i mean a thimblewhats thatits like this she kissed himfunny said peter gravely now shall i give you a thimbleif you wish to said wendy keeping her head erect this timepeter thimbled her and almost immediately she screeched what is it wendyit was exactly as if someone were pulling my hairthat must have been tink i never knew her so naughty beforeand indeed tink was darting about again using offensive languageshe says she will do that to you wendy every time i give you a thimblebut whywhy tinkagain tink replied you silly ass peter could not understand why but wendy understood and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to storiesyou see i dont know any stories none of the lost boys knows any storieshow perfectly awful wendy saiddo you know peter asked why swallows build in the eaves of houses it is to listen to the stories o wendy your mother was telling you such a lovely storywhich story was itabout the prince who couldnt find the lady who wore the glass slipperpeter said wendy excitedly that was cinderella and he found her and they lived happily ever afterpeter was so glad that he rose from the floor where they had been sitting and hurried to the windowwhere are you going she cried with misgivingto tell the other boysdont go peter she entreated i know such lots of storiesthose were her precise words so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted himhe came back and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her but did notoh the stories i could tell to the boys she cried and then peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the windowlet me go she ordered himwendy do come with me and tell the other boysof course she was very pleased to be asked but she said oh dear i cant think of mummy besides i cant flyill teach youoh how lovely to flyill teach you how to jump on the winds back and then away we gooo she exclaimed rapturouslywendy wendy when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the starsooand wendy there are mermaidsmermaids with tailssuch long tailsoh cried wendy to see a mermaidhe had become frightfully cunning wendy he said how we should all respect youshe was wriggling her body in distress it was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floorbut he had no pity for herwendy he said the sly one you could tuck us in at nightoonone of us has ever been tucked in at nightoo and her arms went out to himand you could darn our clothes and make pockets for us none of us has any pocketshow could she resist of course its awfully fascinating she criedpeter would you teach john and michael to fly tooif you like he said indifferently and she ran to john and michael and shook them wake up she cried peter pan has come and he is to teach us to flyjohn rubbed his eyes then i shall get up he said of course he was on the floor already hallo he said i am upmichael was up by this time also looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw but peter suddenly signed silence their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grownup world all was as still as salt then everything was right no stop everything was wrong nana who had been barking distressfully all the evening was quiet now it was her silence they had heardout with the light hide quick cried john taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure and thus when liza entered holding nana the nursery seemed quite its old self very dark and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept they were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtainsliza was in a bad temper for she was mixing the christmas puddings in the kitchen and had been drawn from them with a raisin still on her cheek by nanas absurd suspicions she thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take nana to the nursery for a moment but in custody of coursethere you suspicious brute she said not sorry that nana was in disgrace they are perfectly safe arent they every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed listen to their gentle breathinghere michael encouraged by his success breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected nana knew that kind of breathing and she tried to drag herself out of lizas clutchesbut liza was dense no more of it nana she said sternly pulling her out of the room i warn you if you bark again i shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party and then oh wont master whip you justshe tied the unhappy dog up again but do you think nana ceased to bark bring master and missus home from the party why that was just what she wanted do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe unfortunately liza returned to her puddings and nana seeing that no help would come from her strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it in another moment she had burst into the diningroom of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven her most expressive way of making a communication mr and mrs darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery and without a goodbye to their hostess they rushed into the streetbut it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains and peter pan can do a great deal in ten minuteswe now return to the nurseryits all right john announced emerging from his hidingplace i say peter can you really flyinstead of troubling to answer him peter flew around the room taking the mantelpiece on the wayhow topping said john and michaelhow sweet cried wendyyes im sweet oh i am sweet said peter forgetting his manners againit looked delightfully easy and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds but they always went down instead of upi say how do you do it asked john rubbing his knee he was quite a practical boyyou just think lovely wonderful thoughts peter explained and they lift you up in the airhe showed them againyoure so nippy at it john said couldnt you do it very slowly oncepeter did it both slowly and quickly ive got it now wendy cried john but soon he found he had not not one of them could fly an inch though even michael was in words of two syllables and peter did not know a from zof course peter had been trifling with them for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him fortunately as we have mentioned one of his hands was messy with it and he blew some on each of them with the most superb resultsnow just wiggle your shoulders this way he said and let gothey were all on their beds and gallant michael let go first he did not quite mean to let go but he did it and immediately he was borne across the roomi flewed he screamed while still in midairjohn let go and met wendy near the bathroomoh lovelyoh rippinglook at melook at melook at methey were not nearly so elegant as peter they could not help kicking a little but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling and there is almost nothing so delicious as that peter gave wendy a hand at first but had to desist tink was so indignantup and down they went and round and round heavenly was wendys wordi say cried john why shouldnt we all go outof course it was to this that peter had been luring themmichael was ready he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles but wendy hesitatedmermaids said peter againooand there are piratespirates cried john seizing his sunday hat let us go at onceit was just at this moment that mr and mrs darling hurried with nana out of 27 they ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window and yes it was still shut but the room was ablaze with light and most heartgripping sight of all they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round not on the floor but in the airnot three figures fourin a tremble they opened the street door mr darling would have rushed upstairs but mrs darling signed him to go softly she even tried to make her heart go softlywill they reach the nursery in time if so how delightful for them and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief but there will be no story on the other hand if they are not in time i solemnly promise that it will all come right in the endthey would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them once again the stars blew the window open and that smallest star of all called outcave peterthen peter knew that there was not a moment to lose come he cried imperiously and soared out at once into the night followed by john and michael and wendymr and mrs darling and nana rushed into the nursery too late the birds were flown
