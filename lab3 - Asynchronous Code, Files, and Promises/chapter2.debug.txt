chapter 2 the shadowmrs darling screamed and as if in answer to a bell the door opened and nana entered returned from her evening out she growled and sprang at the boy who leapt lightly through the window again mrs darling screamed this time in distress for him for she thought he was killed and she ran down into the street to look for his little body but it was not there and she looked up and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting starshe returned to the nursery and found nana with something in her mouth which proved to be the boys shadow as he leapt at the window nana had closed it quickly too late to catch him but his shadow had not had time to get out slam went the window and snapped it offyou may be sure mrs darling examined the shadow carefully but it was quite the ordinary kindnana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow she hung it out at the window meaning he is sure to come back for it let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the childrenbut unfortunately mrs darling could not leave it hanging out at the window it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house she thought of showing it to mr darling but he was totting up winter greatcoats for john and michael with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear and it seemed a shame to trouble him besides she knew exactly what he would say it all comes of having a dog for a nurseshe decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband ah methe opportunity came a week later on that nevertobeforgotten friday of course it was a fridayi ought to have been specially careful on a friday she used to say afterwards to her husband while perhaps nana was on the other side of her holding her handno no mr darling always said i am responsible for it all i george darling did it mea culpa mea culpa he had had a classical educationthey sat thus night after night recalling that fatal friday till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinageif only i had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27 mrs darling saidif only i had not poured my medicine into nanas bowl said mr darlingif only i had pretended to like the medicine was what nanas wet eyes saidmy liking for parties georgemy fatal gift of humour dearestmy touchiness about trifles dear master and mistressthen one or more of them would break down altogether nana at the thought its true its true they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse many a time it was mr darling who put the handkerchief to nanas eyesthat fiend mr darling would cry and nanas bark was the echo of it but mrs darling never upbraided peter there was something in the righthand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call peter namesthey would sit there in the empty nursery recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening it had begun so uneventfully so precisely like a hundred other evenings with nana putting on the water for michaels bath and carrying him to it on her backi wont go to bed he had shouted like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject i wont i wont nana it isnt six oclock yet oh dear oh dear i shant love you any more nana i tell you i wont be bathed i wont i wontthen mrs darling had come in wearing her white eveninggown she had dressed early because wendy so loved to see her in her eveninggown with the necklace george had given her she was wearing wendys bracelet on her arm she had asked for the loan of it wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mothershe had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of wendys birth and john was sayingi am happy to inform you mrs darling that you are now a mother in just such a tone as mr darling himself may have used on the real occasionwendy had danced with joy just as the real mrs darling must have donethen john was born with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male and michael came from his bath to ask to be born also but john said brutally that they did not want any moremichael had nearly cried nobody wants me he said and of course the lady in the eveningdress could not stand thati do she said i so want a third childboy or girl asked michael not too hopefullyboythen he had leapt into her arms such a little thing for mr and mrs darling and nana to recall now but not so little if that was to be michaels last night in the nurserythey go on with their recollectionsit was then that i rushed in like a tornado wasnt it mr darling would say scorning himself and indeed he had been like a tornadoperhaps there was some excuse for him he too had been dressing for the party and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie it is an astounding thing to have to tell but this man though he knew about stocks and shares had no real mastery of his tie sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a madeup tiethis was such an occasion he came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his handwhy what is the matter father dearmatter he yelled he really yelled this tie it will not tie he became dangerously sarcastic not round my neck round the bedpost oh yes twenty times have i made it up round the bedpost but round my neck no oh dear no begs to be excusedhe thought mrs darling was not sufficiently impressed and he went on sternly i warn you of this mother that unless this tie is round my neck we dont go out to dinner tonight and if i dont go out to dinner tonight i never go to the office again and if i dont go to the office again you and i starve and our children will be flung into the streetseven then mrs darling was placid let me try dear she said and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him while the children stood around to see their fate decided some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily but mr darling had far too fine a nature for that he thanked her carelessly at once forgot his rage and in another moment was dancing round the room with michael on his backhow wildly we romped says mrs darling now recalling itour last romp mr darling groanedo george do you remember michael suddenly said to me how did you get to know me motheri rememberthey were rather sweet dont you think georgeand they were ours ours and now they are gonethe romp had ended with the appearance of nana and most unluckily mr darling collided against her covering his trousers with hairs they were not only new trousers but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming of course mrs darling brushed him but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nursegeorge nana is a treasureno doubt but i have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppiesoh no dear one i feel sure she knows they have soulsi wonder mr darling said thoughtfully i wonder it was an opportunity his wife felt for telling him about the boy at first he poohpoohed the story but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadowit is nobody i know he said examining it carefully but it does look a scoundrelwe were still discussing it you remember says mr darling when nana came in with michaels medicine you will never carry the bottle in your mouth again nana and it is all my faultstrong man though he was there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine if he had a weakness it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly and so now when michael dodged the spoon in nanas mouth he had said reprovingly be a man michaelwont wont michael cried naughtily mrs darling left the room to get a chocolate for him and mr darling thought this showed want of firmnessmother dont pamper him he called after her michael when i was your age i took medicine without a murmur i said thank you kind parents for giving me bottles to make me wellhe really thought this was true and wendy who was now in her nightgown believed it also and she said to encourage michael that medicine you sometimes take father is much nastier isnt itever so much nastier mr darling said bravely and i would take it now as an example to you michael if i hadnt lost the bottlehe had not exactly lost it he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there what he did not know was that the faithful liza had found it and put it back on his washstandi know where it is father wendy cried always glad to be of serviceill bring it and she was off before he could stop her immediately his spirits sank in the strangest wayjohn he said shuddering its most beastly stuff its that nasty sticky sweet kindit will soon be over father john said cheerily and then in rushed wendy with the medicine in a glassi have been as quick as i could she pantedyou have been wonderfully quick her father retorted with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her michael first he said doggedlyfather first said michael who was of a suspicious naturei shall be sick you know mr darling said threateninglycome on father said johnhold your tongue john his father rapped outwendy was quite puzzled i thought you took it quite easily fatherthat is not the point he retorted the point is that there is more in my glass than in michaels spoon his proud heart was nearly bursting and it isnt fair i would say it though it were with my last breath it isnt fairfather i am waiting said michael coldlyits all very well to say you are waiting so am i waitingfathers a cowardly custardso are you a cowardly custardim not frightenedneither am i frightenedwell then take itwell then you take itwendy had a splendid idea why not both take it at the same timecertainly said mr darling are you ready michaelwendy gave the words one two three and michael took his medicine but mr darling slipped his behind his backthere was a yell of rage from michael and o father wendy exclaimedwhat do you mean by o father mr darling demanded stop that row michael i meant to take mine but ii missed itit was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him just as if they did not admire him look here all of you he said entreatingly as soon as nana had gone into the bathroom i have just thought of a splendid joke i shall pour my medicine into nanas bowl and she will drink it thinking it is milkit was the colour of milk but the children did not have their fathers sense of humour and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into nanas bowl what fun he said doubtfully and they did not dare expose him when mrs darling and nana returnednana good dog he said patting her i have put a little milk into your bowl nananana wagged her tail ran to the medicine and began lapping it then she gave mr darling such a look not an angry look she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs and crept into her kennelmr darling was frightfully ashamed of himself but he would not give in in a horrid silence mrs darling smelt the bowl o george she said its your medicineit was only a joke he roared while she comforted her boys and wendy hugged nana much good he said bitterly my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this houseand still wendy hugged nana thats right he shouted coddle her nobody coddles me oh dear no i am only the breadwinner why should i be coddledwhy why whygeorge mrs darling entreated him not so loud the servants will hear you somehow they had got into the way of calling liza the servantslet them he answered recklessly bring in the whole world but i refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longerthe children wept and nana ran to him beseechingly but he waved her back he felt he was a strong man again in vain in vain he criedthe proper place for you is the yard and there you go to be tied up this instantgeorge george mrs darling whispered remember what i told you about that boyalas he would not listen he was determined to show who was master in that house and when commands would not draw nana from the kennel he lured her out of it with honeyed words and seizing her roughly dragged her from the nursery he was ashamed of himself and yet he did it it was all owing to his too affectionate nature which craved for admiration when he had tied her up in the backyard the wretched father went and sat in the passage with his knuckles to his eyesin the meantime mrs darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their nightlights they could hear nana barking and john whimpered it is because he is chaining her up in the yard but wendy was wiserthat is not nanas unhappy bark she said little guessing what was about to happen that is her bark when she smells dangerdangerare you sure wendyoh yesmrs darling quivered and went to the window it was securely fastened she looked out and the night was peppered with stars they were crowding round the house as if curious to see what was to take place there but she did not notice this nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry oh how i wish that i wasnt going to a party tonighteven michael already half asleep knew that she was perturbed and he asked can anything harm us mother after the nightlights are litnothing precious she said they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her childrenshe went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them and little michael flung his arms round her mother he cried im glad of you they were the last words she was to hear from him for a long timeno 27 was only a few yards distant but there had been a slight fall of snow and father and mother darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes they were already the only persons in the street and all the stars were watching them stars are beautiful but they may not take an active part in anything they must just look on for ever it is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was so the older ones have become glassyeyed and seldom speak winking is the star language but the little ones still wonder they are not really friendly to peter who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side tonight and anxious to get the grownups out of the way so as soon as the door of 27 closed on mr and mrs darling there was a commotion in the firmament and the smallest of all the stars in the milky way screamed outnow peter
