	"story": "During my time at the company, along with co-worker Mike Harrington, I was impressed by computer games that were being released in the mid 1990s, such as id Software's Doom and Quake. Fully convinced that games were the future of entertainment, and intrigued by the prospect of having my own development studio. So I left Microsoft to co-found Valve in 1996, where I remain its president."
